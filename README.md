Lets you control your tello with a gamingcontroller supported by pygame

The following program lets you control your Tello-drone with any gaming controller that
pygame supports.
To run a playstation controller, further requirements are needed to run the program.
If you want to use a playstation 3 or 4-controller, try your luck with the following links:

There is in fact ways to also use fx a playstation 2 controller but caution is advised to
prevent you from downloading malicious code.
